# WAMR Integration Research for nRF5340

## What is WAMR?

WAMR (WebAssembly Micro Runtime) is a lightweight WebAssembly runtime designed for embedded systems and IoT devices. It's developed by Intel and is designed to be:
- Small footprint (typically 50KB-100KB)
- Fast execution
- Portable across different platforms
- Suitable for resource-constrained devices

## WAMR and Zephyr Integration

### Current Status
WAMR is **NOT** currently included in the Nordic Connect SDK (NCS) or Zephyr RTOS by default. This means we need to integrate it manually.

### Integration Approaches

#### Option 1: Manual Integration (Recommended for Phase 2)
- Download WAMR source code
- Configure CMake build system
- Port WAMR to Zephyr platform
- Handle platform-specific adaptations

#### Option 2: Use Zephyr's Native Support
- Zephyr has some WebAssembly support through its native toolchain
- Limited compared to full WAMR runtime
- May not support dynamic loading

#### Option 3: Alternative WASM Runtimes
- Wasm3: Another lightweight WASM runtime
- Wasmer: More feature-rich but larger footprint
- Custom minimal WASM interpreter

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Current Status âœ…
- Mock WASM interpreter working
- BLE communication established
- Basic infrastructure in place

### Phase 2: Real WAMR Integration
1. **Download WAMR Source**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime.git
   ```

2. **Platform Adaptation**
   - Adapt WAMR for Zephyr/ARM Cortex-M33
   - Handle memory management
   - Implement system calls for Zephyr

3. **Build System Integration**
   - Add WAMR as external dependency
   - Configure CMake for cross-compilation
   - Handle ARM-specific optimizations

4. **Runtime Integration**
   - Initialize WAMR runtime in Zephyr
   - Handle WASM module loading
   - Implement error handling

### Technical Challenges

#### Memory Management
- WAMR needs dynamic memory allocation
- Zephyr has limited heap space
- Need to implement custom allocator

#### System Calls
- WASM modules may need system calls
- Must map to Zephyr APIs
- Handle file I/O, networking, etc.

#### Performance
- JIT compilation not available on ARM Cortex-M33
- Interpreter mode only
- Memory overhead for runtime

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Research WAMR Source Code**
   - Study the architecture
   - Identify minimal components needed
   - Understand platform abstraction layer

2. **Create Integration Plan**
   - Define minimal WASM feature set
   - Plan memory layout
   - Design error handling

3. **Implement Incrementally**
   - Start with basic WASM parsing
   - Add simple instruction execution
   - Integrate with existing BLE system

## Conclusion

WAMR integration is feasible but requires significant work. The current mock implementation provides a good foundation for testing the overall system architecture. For Phase 2, we should start with a minimal WASM implementation and gradually add WAMR features as needed.
