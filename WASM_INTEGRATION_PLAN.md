# WASM Integration Plan for nRF5340

## Overview
This branch explores integrating a WebAssembly (WASM) interpreter into the nRF5340 BLE peripheral project, enabling dynamic code execution on the device.

## Goals
- Run WASM modules on the nRF5340
- Execute dynamic code received via BLE
- Maintain the existing BLE peripheral functionality
- Provide a sandboxed execution environment

## Technical Approach

### 1. WASM Interpreter Selection

**Primary Candidates:**
- **WAMR (WebAssembly Micro Runtime)** - Lightweight, designed for embedded systems
- **wasm3** - Fast WASM interpreter, good for microcontrollers
- **Wasmtime** - More feature-rich but larger footprint

**Recommendation: WAMR**
- Small memory footprint (~50-100KB)
- Good performance for embedded systems
- Active development and community support
- Built-in WASI support

### 2. Integration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Basic WASM Interpreter
- Add WAMR as a Zephyr module
- Create basic WASM execution environment
- Test with simple WASM modules

#### Phase 2: BLE Integration
- Extend BLE service to receive WASM bytecode
- Add WASM module validation and loading
- Execute received WASM code

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) support
- Memory management and sandboxing
- Error handling and recovery

### 3. Implementation Plan

#### 3.1 Add WAMR Module
```bash
# Add WAMR to west.yml
cd ~/ncs
west update
```

#### 3.2 Extend BLE Service
- Add new characteristic for WASM bytecode upload
- Implement bytecode validation
- Add execution status reporting

#### 3.3 WASM Runtime Integration
- Initialize WAMR runtime
- Load and execute WASM modules
- Handle runtime errors gracefully

### 4. Memory Considerations

**nRF5340 Memory Layout:**
- Application Core: 1MB Flash, 448KB RAM
- Network Core: 256KB Flash, 64KB RAM

**WASM Memory Requirements:**
- WAMR Runtime: ~50-100KB
- WASM Module Storage: ~10-100KB per module
- Execution Stack: ~1-10KB per instance

**Strategy:**
- Use external flash for WASM module storage
- Implement memory pooling for runtime
- Limit concurrent WASM instances

### 5. Security Considerations

- **Code Validation**: Verify WASM bytecode integrity
- **Memory Isolation**: Sandbox WASM execution
- **Resource Limits**: Cap memory and execution time
- **BLE Security**: Authenticate uploads if needed

### 6. BLE Service Design

```c
// Extended BLE service structure
BT_GATT_SERVICE_DEFINE(wasm_service,
    BT_GATT_PRIMARY_SERVICE(&wasm_service_uuid.uuid),
    
    // WASM bytecode upload characteristic
    BT_GATT_CHARACTERISTIC(&wasm_bytecode_uuid.uuid,
                           BT_GATT_CHRC_WRITE,
                           BT_GATT_PERM_WRITE,
                           NULL, on_wasm_upload, NULL),
    
    // Execution status characteristic
    BT_GATT_CHARACTERISTIC(&wasm_status_uuid.uuid,
                           BT_GATT_CHRC_READ | BT_GATT_CHRC_NOTIFY,
                           BT_GATT_PERM_READ,
                           read_wasm_status, NULL, NULL),
    
    // Execution result characteristic
    BT_GATT_CHARACTERISTIC(&wasm_result_uuid.uuid,
                           BT_GATT_CHRC_READ | BT_GATT_CHRC_NOTIFY,
                           BT_GATT_PERM_READ,
                           read_wasm_result, NULL, NULL),
);
```

### 7. Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Research WAMR integration with Zephyr
- [ ] Add WAMR module to project
- [ ] Basic WASM runtime initialization
- [ ] Simple WASM module execution test

#### Phase 2: BLE Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] Extend BLE service for WASM upload
- [ ] Implement bytecode validation
- [ ] Basic execution pipeline
- [ ] Error handling

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
- [ ] WASI support for system calls
- [ ] Memory management optimization
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] Security hardening

### 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- WASM module loading
- Runtime execution
- Memory management
- Error handling

#### Integration Tests
- BLE upload and execution
- Concurrent module handling
- Memory pressure scenarios
- Error recovery

#### Performance Tests
- Execution speed benchmarks
- Memory usage profiling
- Battery impact assessment

### 9. Success Metrics

- **Performance**: WASM execution < 100ms for simple operations
- **Memory**: Runtime overhead < 100KB
- **Reliability**: 99%+ successful execution rate
- **Security**: No memory corruption or unauthorized access

### 10. Risks and Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
- **Memory constraints**: Implement aggressive memory management
- **Performance overhead**: Profile and optimize critical paths
- **Integration complexity**: Start simple, iterate incrementally

#### Security Risks
- **Code injection**: Validate all WASM bytecode
- **Resource exhaustion**: Implement strict limits
- **Privilege escalation**: Sandbox execution environment

## Next Steps

1. **Research WAMR integration** with Zephyr
2. **Create proof-of-concept** with basic WASM execution
3. **Evaluate memory and performance** impact
4. **Design BLE service** architecture
5. **Implement incremental** features
